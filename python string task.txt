1. Coffee Shop Ordering System (Basic)
Scenario:
You are developing a simple ordering system for a new coffee shop. The system needs to calculate the total bill for a customer's order and apply a discount if applicable. 
Task:
Create a Python program that performs the following actions:
Display a menu with item names and prices (e.g., Coffee: $3.50, Muffin: $2.00, Bagel: $4.00).
Prompt the user to select items and quantities.
Calculate the total cost of the order.
Apply a 10% discount if the total bill exceeds $20.00.
Display the final amount payable. 

2.Scenario: You are processing credit card numbers (e.g., "4532111188885678").
Task: Write a function that:
Takes the string as input.
Returns a "masked" version where all digits except the last 4 are replaced by * (e.g., "************5678").
Focus: Function definitions, string slicing, and the * repetition operator.
